# Image Caption Generator

The jupyter notebook takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption that accurately describes the contents of the image. The process involves several key steps, including feature extraction from images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) VGG16, tokenizing and preprocessing textual data, and training a sequence model to generate captions based on the extracted image features and input sequences. Additionally, the project incorporates techniques like data augmentation, tokenization, and padding to enhance model performance and robustness. The dataset used comes from Kaggle and the code follows a tutorial found online.
